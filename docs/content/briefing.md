# Briefing

Welcome, trainee, to the exciting world of Rakuten Space! After years of research, development, and testing, the time has finally come to open early bird bookings for our space shuttle service
Rakuten Space has worked tirelessly to ensure that space travel is now a reality, and we're thrilled to have you on board for this groundbreaking mission.

As part of our dedicated team, you've been selected to develop the frontend for the booking system, the heart of our journey into space. This is no small task, but we believe in your skills and creativity to bring the vision to life. Your work will play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth and exciting booking experience for our first customers, who will be among the first to book their tickets for journeys beyond Earth!

The road ahead might come with some challenges, but that's all part of the adventure. You'll encounter new concepts, fine-tune your Vue.js skills, and collaborate closely with a system that spans multiple sections of the booking process. But don't worry, we've broken down each part of the project into manageable missions that will guide you step-by-step through this process.

Success in this mission will require focus, attention to detail, and the ability to solve complex problemsâ€”but most importantly, it requires passion and the spirit of exploration. This is your opportunity to not just learn, but to shape the future of space travel with Rakuten Space. We want you to have fun with this, experiment, and enjoy the journey of learning and building!

Let's make space travel accessible to the world. The stars are waiting for you, and so is Rakuten Space!
