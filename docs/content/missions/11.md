### Mission 11: Enhance Overview Page with Trip Details

In this mission, youâ€™ll enhance the overview page to show more detailed information about each trip when clicked.

Guidelines:
1. Implement a feature where users can click a trip from the overview page to view detailed information about it.
2. Show the status of the trip (confirmed, pending), meal options, and trip cost.
3. Allow users to cancel or modify their booking directly from the trip details page.

Development hints:
- Use Vue Router to manage navigation between trip details and the overview page.
- Test for scenarios where users may modify or cancel their bookings.
