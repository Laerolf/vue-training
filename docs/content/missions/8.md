### Mission 8: Create the Overview Page

After logging in, users need a place to manage their bookings. In this mission, you’ll create the overview page where users can see all their trips.

Guidelines:
1. Create an `OverviewPage` component to display the user’s trips.
2. List each trip with a summary of key details: departure point, destination, and travel package.
3. Provide options to view more details or cancel the trip.

Development hints:
- Use dynamic routing to display details when a user clicks on a trip.
- Test the API to retrieve a list of the user’s trips.

Up next:
Allow users to view detailed information about a selected trip.
