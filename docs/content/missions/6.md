### Mission 6: Create the Signup Page

In this mission, you’ll build the signup page for new users to create their accounts. This will allow travelers to join Rakuten Space before booking their trips.

Guidelines:
1. Create a `SignupPage` component with fields for email, password, and password confirmation.
2. Add validation to ensure passwords are strong and match the confirmation field.
3. Provide a “Create Account” button that triggers the signup API.

Development hints:
- Use `v-model` for data binding on form fields.
- Display real-time feedback to users about password strength.

Up next:
Build the login page for existing users.
