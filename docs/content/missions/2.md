### Mission 2: Implement Form Field Validation

Now that the first section is ready, itâ€™s time to ensure the input fields are validated. This mission will cover adding basic validation for required fields and proper selections.

Guidelines:
1. Add client-side validation to the departure, destination, and travel package fields.
2. Prevent form submission if any required fields are invalid.
3. Display inline error messages for invalid or missing data.

Development hints:
- Use conditional rendering to show error messages only when fields are invalid.
- Consider using libraries like VeeValidate for smoother validation handling.

Up next:
Populate the form with field values from an API.
