### Mission 4: Handle Errors and Display Friendly Messages

This mission focuses on improving the user experience by handling errors effectively. You’ll ensure that any issues, such as form validation errors or API failures, are communicated clearly to users.

Guidelines:
1. Implement global error handling in the form.
2. Display error messages inline within form fields when an issue occurs.
3. Ensure that users are notified of failed API requests with helpful messages.

Development hints:
- Use Vue’s computed properties or watchers to manage real-time error checking.
- Add visual cues (e.g., red borders or icons) to fields with errors.
