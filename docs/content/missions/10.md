### Mission 10: Create the Login Page

After enabling signup, you’ll create the login page for existing users to access their Rakuten Space accounts.

Guidelines:
1. Design a `LoginPage` component with fields for email and password.
2. Add a “Log In” button that triggers the login API to authenticate users.
3. Include error handling for invalid credentials and display helpful messages.
4. Redirect users to their dashboard upon successful login.

Development hints:
- Use Vue Router to navigate between the login page and the dashboard.
- Test the API response handling for success and failure scenarios.
- Write integration tests to verify the full login flow.

Up next:
Build the overview page to let users manage their trips.
