## Mission 0: Briefing

Welcome aboard! Before diving into the development of Rakuten Space’s early bird booking system, it’s crucial to set up the foundation for a smooth journey. This mission will help you prepare your Vue project, understand its key requirements, and introduce core concepts like Component Driven Development (CDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD). These practices will guide you in crafting robust, reusable components and ensuring your work meets expectations right from the start.

### Guidelines:
1. **Set up your Vue project**:
   - Use Vue CLI or Vite to create a new Vue project.
   - Ensure you include support for Composition API and Single File Components (SFCs).
   - Install essential dependencies, including:
     - `vue-router` for routing
     - `pinia` for state management (optional for later missions)
     - `axios` for API communication
     - `vite` or `webpack` for build optimization (depending on project tooling).

2. **Explore Component Driven Development (CDD)**:
   - Understand the concept: Break down your UI into reusable, testable, and isolated components.
   - Recommended reading:
     - [Storybook’s guide to Component-Driven Development](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/introduction)
   - Practice creating simple Vue components, such as a `<Button>` or `<Card>`.

3. **Dive into Test Driven Development (TDD)**:
   - Learn the TDD cycle: *Write a test → Fail → Write code → Pass → Refactor*.
   - Install and set up testing libraries:
     - `vitest` for unit testing
     - `testing-library/vue` for component interaction tests

4. **Read through essential documentation**:
   - [Vue.js official guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) (core concepts, Composition API, and SFCs)
   - [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) (to handle navigation in the project)
   - [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) (optional, for managing state later)
   - [Testing Library for Vue](https://testing-library.com/docs/vue-testing-library/intro)

### Development hints:
- Use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` to manage dependencies. If you’re new to `pnpm`, check out [this guide](https://pnpm.io/).
- Use a modular folder structure to keep components, tests, and assets organized.
- Use TDD to create robust components. Start with small, testable features like a button or form field.
