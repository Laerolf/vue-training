### Mission 5: Create the Confirmation Page for Booking

After completing the form, users need to review their choices before confirming their booking. You’ll develop a confirmation page that summarizes the entered details and allows the user to confirm or edit their selection.

Guidelines:
1. Create a `ConfirmationPage` component that shows all form details.
2. Allow users to edit their information before final submission.
3. Include a “Confirm” button to finalize the booking.

Development hints:
- Use Vue Router to navigate between the form and confirmation page.
- Think about user flow—make it easy for users to go back and edit their information.

Create a login page for new or returning users.
