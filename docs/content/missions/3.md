### Mission 3: Populate Form with Field Values from an API

To enhance the user experience, you will fetch values for the departure points, destination points, and travel packages from an external API.

Guidelines:
1. Fetch data from an API to populate the dropdowns for departure points, destination points, and travel packages.
2. Populate the form fields dynamically with the fetched data.
3. Handle errors gracefully if the API request fails.

Development hints:
- Use Axios for making API requests.
- Update the formâ€™s state when new data is received from the API.

Handle errors and display user-friendly error messages.
