### Mission 7: Create the Login Page

In this mission, you’ll create the login page where existing users can sign in to access their accounts and book a trip.

Guidelines:
1. Create a `LoginPage` component with fields for email and password.
2. Add a “Log In” button that triggers the login API to authenticate users.
3. Handle errors gracefully if credentials are incorrect and provide helpful feedback.

Development hints:
- Use Vue Router to navigate between the login page and the user’s dashboard.
- Write tests to verify successful and failed login attempts.

Up next:
Build the overview page to display a list of all the user’s trips.
