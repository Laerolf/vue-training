### Mission 9: Create the Signup Page

To welcome new travelers to Rakuten Space, you’ll build a signup page where users can create an account. This page will ensure users are onboarded to the system smoothly.

Guidelines:
1. Design a `SignupPage` component with fields for email, password, and confirm password.
2. Add validation rules for strong passwords and matching confirm password fields.
3. Include a “Create Account” button that triggers the signup API.
4. Display success or error messages based on the API response.

Development hints:
- Use `v-model` to bind input data to the component state.
- Write unit tests to verify validation rules and API interactions.
- Consider adding real-time feedback (e.g., password strength indicator) for a better user experience.
