## Mission 1: Build the First Section of the Form

In this mission, you'll create the first section of the shuttle booking form, which includes fields for departure point, destination point, and travel package. This will lay the foundation for the booking process.

### Guidelines:
1. Create a `VoyageInformation` component with fields for the departure point, destination point, and travel package.
2. Use Vueâ€™s `v-model` for two-way data binding on form fields.
3. Design the section to be user-friendly and intuitive.

### Development hints:
- Start with creating the basic structure using Vue components.
- Think about how each field will interact with the form state.

### Up next:
Implement form field validation to ensure correct input.
